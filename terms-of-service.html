        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our website, platform, and related services (collectively, the "Platform"). By accessing or using the Platform, creating an account, clicking "I agree," or completing a booking, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.</p>

        <p><strong>1.</strong> Assured Hearts is a two-sided online marketplace that enables families to discover, connect with, and book independent childcare providers. The Platform is purpose-built for Muslim families seeking faith-aligned childcare and for caregivers who affirm their ability to provide childcare consistent with Islamic values and family expectations.</p>
        <p><strong>1.1</strong> Assured Hearts is a technology platform only. We do not provide childcare services, do not employ caregivers, and do not supervise or control childcare arrangements. Care Services are provided by independent caregivers, not by Assured Hearts.</p>
        <p><strong>1.2</strong> Caregivers are independent third-party providers. Nothing in these Terms creates an employment, agency, partnership, or joint venture relationship between Assured Hearts and any Caregiver.</p>

        <p><strong>2.</strong> Definitions "Family" means a user seeking childcare services. "Caregiver" means a user offering childcare services. "Care Services" means childcare services arranged between a Family and a Caregiver. "User" means any person who accesses or uses the Platform, including Families and Caregivers. "Content" means text, images, profiles, listings, messages, reviews, documents, and other materials posted or made available through the Platform. "Resources" means educational materials, guides, curriculum, downloads, and subscription content offered by Assured Hearts.</p>

        <p><strong>3.</strong> You must be legally capable of entering a binding contract in your jurisdiction and must provide accurate, current, and complete information when creating an account and using the Platform. Caregivers must be at least eighteen (18) years of age and legally permitted to provide childcare services in their jurisdiction.</p>
        <p><strong>3.1</strong> The Platform is not intended for use by minors.</p>
        <p><strong>3.2</strong> If you use the Platform on behalf of an organization, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.</p>

        <p><strong>4.</strong> You are responsible for all activity on your account and for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials.</p>
        <p><strong>4.1</strong> You must notify us promptly of any unauthorized access or suspected security breach related to your account.</p>
        <p><strong>4.2</strong> We may suspend or terminate accounts to protect Users, the community, or the integrity of the Platform, including where we believe there has been a violation of these Terms.</p>

        <p><strong>5.</strong> The Platform is designed for families seeking childcare aligned with Islamic values. The following standards help protect trust and clarity for all Users.</p>
        <p><strong>5.1</strong> Caregivers who list services on the Platform must affirm that they:</p>
        <ul class="terms-list">
          <li>understand the Platform serves families seeking faith-aligned care; and</li>
          <li>are willing and able to provide Care Services consistent with Islamic values and the Family's communicated expectations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This affirmation relates to service standards and conduct and does not require any person to disclose personal religious identity.</p>
        <p><strong>5.2</strong> Users must engage respectfully and must not harass, threaten, defame, or abuse other Users. Users must not use the Platform to promote hatred, violence, or unlawful discrimination.</p>

        <p><strong>6.</strong> Caregivers may create profiles and listings. Families may browse listings, communicate with caregivers, and request or book Care Services through the Platform.</p>
        <p><strong>6.1</strong> Assured Hearts implements a vetting process designed to promote trust and safety. This process may include identity verification, reference checks, screening questionnaires, and community-based indicators. Caregivers who complete this process may be identified as "vetted" on the Platform.</p>
        <p><strong>6.2</strong> While we take vetting seriously, vetting is not a guarantee of performance, safety, suitability, or outcome. Families remain responsible for their own due diligence, including interviews, reference checks, and confirming whether a caregiver meets their specific needs.</p>

        <p><strong>7.</strong> Assured Hearts facilitates bookings and processes payments between Families and Caregivers using third-party payment processors.</p>
        <p><strong>7.1</strong> When a Family completes a booking, the Family authorizes payment of the amount shown at checkout, including any Platform fees and applicable taxes disclosed at the time of booking.</p>
        <p><strong>7.2</strong> When a Caregiver accepts a booking, the Caregiver agrees to provide the Care Services as described and as agreed with the Family, subject to any cancellation policy applicable to the booking.</p>
        <p><strong>7.3</strong> Platform service fees, if any, will be disclosed at checkout or in the applicable policy and may change from time to time.</p>
        <p><strong>7.4</strong> Payment processing may be provided by third parties. Your use of payment features may be subject to the payment processor's terms and privacy practices.</p>

        <p><strong>8.</strong> Cancellation and refund rules are disclosed at the time of booking and may vary by booking type, timing, or service.</p>
        <p><strong>8.1</strong> Any cancellation and refund policy presented at checkout is incorporated into these Terms by reference and forms part of the agreement between the Family, the Caregiver, and the Platform for that booking.</p>
        <p><strong>8.2</strong> Assured Hearts may provide tools or processes to assist in dispute resolution but is not responsible for the Care Services themselves except where required by law or explicitly stated in an applicable policy.</p>

        <p><strong>9.</strong> Assured Hearts may offer Resources that caregivers and parents can access independently of Care Services.</p>
        <p><strong>9.</strong> Access to Resources does not require booking childcare through the Platform.</p>
        <p><strong>9.2</strong> Unless otherwise stated, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use Resources for personal or internal household use. You may not resell, redistribute, or publicly post Resources without our written permission.</p>
        <p><strong>9.3</strong> Resources are educational and informational only and are not legal, medical, or professional advice.</p>

        <p><strong>10.</strong> Users may post reviews and feedback based on genuine experiences. Reviews must be truthful, respectful, and not misleading.</p>
        <p><strong>10.1</strong> We may remove Content that violates these Terms or that we reasonably believe undermines trust and safety.</p>

        <p><strong>11.</strong> You agree not to use the Platform for unlawful purposes or in ways that harm others or the Platform.</p>
        <p><strong>11.1</strong> Prohibited activities. You must not:</p>
        <ul class="terms-list">
          <li>misrepresent your identity or qualifications</li>
          <li>post false, misleading, or fraudulent listings</li>
          <li>attempt to bypass Platform payment features to avoid fees</li>
          <li>interfere with Platform security or operations</li>
          <li>collect or share sensitive personal information beyond what is reasonably required for childcare coordination</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>12.</strong> You retain ownership of Content you submit, but you grant Assured Hearts a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, display, reproduce, modify (for formatting), and distribute your Content to operate and promote the Platform. The Platform, branding, and Resources are owned by Assured Hearts or its licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws.</p>

        <p><strong>13.</strong> Childcare involves inherent risks. By using the Platform, you acknowledge that Care Services are provided by independent caregivers and that Assured Hearts does not supervise or control care. If you believe a child is in immediate danger, call emergency services.</p>

        <p><strong>14.</strong> The Platform may contain links to third-party sites or services. We do not control and are not responsible for third parties' content, policies, or practices.</p>

        <p><strong>15.</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Platform is provided "as is" and "as available." We do not warrant that the Platform will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure, or that any caregiver will meet your expectations.</p>

        <p><strong>16.</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by law, Assured Hearts will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill.</p>
        <p><strong>16.1</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by law, Assured Hearts' total liability arising out of or related to the Platform will not exceed the greater of: (a) the amounts you paid to Assured Hearts in the prior six (6) months for the relevant service; or (b) CAD $5,000. Nothing in these Terms limits liability where such limitation is not permitted by law.</p>

        <p><strong>17.</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Assured Hearts and its directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from:</p>
        <ul class="terms-list">
          <li>your use of the Platform</li>
          <li>your Content</li>
          <li>your interactions with other Users</li>
          <li>any Care Services you provide or receive</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>18.</strong> We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms, create risk for others, or harm the integrity of the Platform.</p>
        <p><strong>18.1</strong> Sections intended to survive termination will survive, including provisions related to intellectual property, disclaimers, limitation of liability, and indemnity.</p>

        <p><strong>19.</strong> Your use of the Platform is subject to our Privacy Policy: <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. You agree that we may collect, use, and disclose information as described in the Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p><strong>20.</strong> Changes to These Terms: We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated Terms and revise the "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the Platform after changes means you accept the updated Terms. If changes are material, we may provide additional notice (for example, email or in-platform notice).</p>

        <p><strong>21.</strong> These Terms are governed by the laws of the Province of Saskatchewan and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to conflict-of-laws rules. You agree that any dispute will be brought in the courts located in Saskatchewan, unless we both agree to an alternative dispute resolution process.</p>
